HTTP requests: 
* Defines how we make a request. 
* The Internet is essentially a collection of data being sent back and forth. How do we send data back and forth?
    * We use HTTP: hypertext transfer protocol. Your browser and the entire Internet interfaces with HTTP. 
    * So to interact with users, search engines, other websites, we need to under HTTP requests. 
* What is a request? 
    * Data = payload of what we send back and forth. 
    * The three biggest common requests are get, post, and put (also called HTTP verbs). 
    * We want to stick to the defined guidelines to making requests to make your code clean and interpoerable. 
        * GET request (from perspective of the user): 
            Please make a GET this data at this place (URL).
        * POST request:
            Us sending data: please post this to this location. 
        * PUT request:
            How we update data. Please send this data to this location to update this data. 
===================================================================================================================
* When writing a request:
    It has an address to and address from and the message!
    * Start line: includes the HTTP methods type (i.e GET, POST, PUT), 
        request URL (target of the HTTP request, which is the server you will interact with), 
        and HTTP version (defines the structure of the message). 
    * HTTP head: HTTP header can provide information such as how the 
        resource should be fetched, content length, how client should be 
        processing the resource, and etc.
    * HTTP body: request message body. 
===================================================================================================================
NOTE: A request has nothing to do with a website. Websites are by-products of requests, but requests 
just interacts with the internet and interact with data. 
Your terminal and your browser makes the SAME request; it's just that the browser handle the request 
different! Try example.com on both your browser and your terminal.
    A URL is an alias to a server because that's what your ISP says it does!
NOTE on API: API can be designed however you want! So you need to document your API really really well. 
===================================================================================================================

HTTP responses: 
* Only responding to requests asked: if it's successful and why; if it fails then why. 
    There are code associated with responses. The first digit indicates that it went right/wrong. 
    The last two digits indicates the "why" it went right/wrong. For example, 200 means request is successful.
    400 means successful; 401 = unauthorized; 404 = not found; 500 = server error. 
===================================================================================================================

CURL
* The most simple way of making a request. 

https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto
    * https:// specifies which protocol is being used 
    * pokeapi.co = domain name, is an alias to servers 
    * /api/v2 = usually this means the server will send data back (just pure data)
    * there are query parameters ...
===================================================================================================================

JSON
* To ensure interoperability, there's a standardize data format. If you send a request, you'd want your 
response to be deterministic. 
* JSON = javascript object notation - every language can use JSON as a way to store data for data transfer.
It has NOTHING to do with javascript. JSON is a janky dictionary (with key-value pairs). It's a very flexible 
and efficient way to exchange data because it's infinitely nestable. 

===================================================================================================================

REST:
* REST is all about design: how an API should be designed and how data should be transferred. 
Smarter design leads to smarter products (i.e less work on everyone - the builders and the users).
Everything is about for efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability.
REST is a design principle for HTTP. It's a promise from you to the users that you will follow these design principles 
(i.e you will send and present data a certain way that allows for interoperability).
* There are 6 guiding principles:
    - Client-server: keep the backend and frontend separate; we make requests between them. 
    Essentially abstract the user interface away from backend concerns to allow for portability 
    (i.e can run an application on multiple platforms).
    - Stateless: each request must contain all the information; we do not assume 
    that the server knows or store information beforehand.
    - Cacheable: cache constraints require that the response to a request explicitly (or implicitly) states whether
    the data is Cacheable or not Cacheable. The client server can then re-use cacheable data.
    - Uniform interace: incorporating the principle of generality from software engineering. In essence, the principle of 
    generality deals with the problem that in computer science, we want to write code that optimize several metrics. 
    However, in theory, the algorithm that can optimize several metrics require longer run-time, so generally you'd want 
    to deal with one metric at a time. The principle of generality essentially says that you want to generalize your 
    code such that it stands the test of time (i.e stands the changes in your business practices, etc.)
    - Layered system: components of one layer cannot view the contents of components in another layer. 
    - Code on demand: REST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading 
    and executing code in the form of applets or scripts.
