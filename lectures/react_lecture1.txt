The basic pieces 

1. Node: JS interpreter (i.e translates high-level programming languages to low-level programming languages 
aka machine code for the machine to understand) for the server. It's an open-source server-side 
runtime environment. It allows you to write all parts of your program in JS, and preserves JS's asynchronousity 
and event-based characteristics.

2. NPM: a package manager (i.e a collection of tools that automates the process of installing, 
upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer's operating system in a consistent manner) for JS. 

3. create-react-app: A good starter environment for running React.

                import React from 'react';
                import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
                import './index.css';
                import App from './App';

                ReactDOM.render(
                <React.StrictMode>
                    <App />
                </React.StrictMode>,
                document.getElementById('root')
                );

    a) ReactDOM: DOM is a standard that dictates how you access and update information and style of a document. 
    ReactDOM provides useful tools of managing DOM elements of the webpage.
    b) React.StrictMode: a tool for highlighting potential problems.
    c) <App />: a custom tag 
    d) document.getElementById('root'): We're injecting our ReactDOM-rendered element into the "root" of the page. 

4. JSX: syntax extension to JS (i.e similar to a template language).

What is React?
    - Framework to help run JS.
    - In React, instead of working with the DOM directly, you work with the virtual DOM. 
    - Based on the idea of components:
        - For example, there is a like button that's reused in multiple parts of the page. 


===================================================================================================================
Anatomy of React App:

Getting started 
    - Creating your first React app
        - Run npx create-react-app whateveryounameyourfile to create the boiler plate.
        - Boiler plate: a starting template for React. 
        - Local host: when you started an app but it's still on your machine. 
            run npm start to run your local host 
        
    - Go into the boiler plate 
        - src folder 
            - App.js: where your main app is at. 
            - index.js: where we will edit 
        - public 
            - index.html: it imports content from index.js; you'd want to separate 
                this index.html with the index.js so it's easier to read. You rarely 
                need to edit this. 
        - node_modules 
            - dependencies that create React 
            - usually you don't edit these 
        - package.json: 
            - tells you your dependencies, your versions, templates of CSS, any fonts,
                any packages you can install 
            - build: send something to the server 
            - start: start building 
            - test: create tests for your website
            - eject: dangerous, please don't use 
        - .gitignore:
            - anything in gitignore will not be pushed onto git because in principle 
            it shouldn't be changed; so it'll include node_modules.

Introduction to State and Props
    - Props (short for properties): used to pass data between different React components.
        Data flow is unidirectionally, from parent to child. 

                        class ParentComponent extends Component {
                            render() { // render component from HTML into elements on the webpage
                                return (
                                    <ChildComponent name="First Child" /> 
                                    // get data from parent component and assign to child component 
                                )
                            }
                        }

                        const ChildComponent = (props) => {
                            return <p>{props.name}</p>;
                        }


    - State: React's built-in object, which allows components to maintain their own properties (i.e data).
    Unlike props, components cannot pass data with states, but only create and manage it internally. 

                        class Test extends React.Component {
                            constructor() {
                                this.state = {
                                    id: 1,
                                    name: 'test'
                                };
                            }

                            render() { // render component from HTML into elements on the webpage
                                return (
                                    <div>
                                        <p>{this.state.id}</p>
                                        <p>{this.state.name}</p>
                                    </div>
                                )
                            }
                        }

                        // updating the state
                        this.setState({id: '2020'});

                        // you can declare it at the start 
                        const [value, setValue] = useState(props.value);
