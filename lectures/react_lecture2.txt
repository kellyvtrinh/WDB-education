Props
    - a dictionary that maintains variable
    - allows passing data from parent component to child component 
    - props are immutable; so you cannot change it in the child component


Adding additional tags 
            <button className="square" onClick={() => alert("onClick")}>
                {props.value} 
            </button>
        
        Note that for the onClick, we return a function that returns alert 
        instead of returning alert directly because in that case, during 
        rendering if there's no buffering, then alert would be called.
