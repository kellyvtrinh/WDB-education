1. What is the Internet?

    - Originated from a government project to create a network that would survive a nuclear attack. 
    - There's no single entity that controls the Internet; it's a combination of distributed network that 
    communicate with each other. 

2. How is information transferred? 

    - Information is sent through electricity, light, and radio waves. 
    - Information at its basic is encoded as binary information: bits of 0 and 1. 
    - To send the information, you can bounce light through optic cables that are physically 
    connected across oceans. You'll need to care about bandwidth, or the maximum amount of 
    information that you can transfer over a device. We also care about latency, or how 
    fast can a bit of information pass through a point of the wire. 
    - Or using radio waves that encode bits into different wave frequencies (i.e wifi).

3. IP addresses and DNS

    - The Internet is not just a physical system, but also a design philosophy; essentially 
    there is a set of protocols that define how information is sent and processed throughout the Internet. 
    - All devices on the Internet have unique addresses, called IP addresses. When you send information, 
    similar to sending mail, you need to include an address sent to and sent from.
    - A system called DNS associates these IP addresses to the alias (i.e the URL). For example, when a 
    device wants to receive information from www.example.com, it sends a request to a DNS server, which 
    may communicate with other DNS server to help map the URL to IP address required. 
    - Since this a distributed system, hackers can access the servers and perform DNS spoofing, which is 
    changing the mapping of URLs with IP addresses, so that the URL will map to the fake IP address. 

4. What does the information do when it's transferred? 

    - Imagine a big object (such as a space shuttle) that needs to be transported to its launch location. 
    The space shuttle will be disassembled, placed into packets of different trucks that take different 
    routes to get to the same location. A team will be there to check if all the necessary packets are 
    present, and then the space shuttle will be re-assembled at the launch location!
    - Similarly, information (i.e image, video, or audio file) will be broken up into many information 
    packets. Each packets take a different route to get to get to the destination. 
    - Routers are devices that manage the traffic; it figures out the cheapest way to the destination 
    based on politics, infrastructure, time, etc. Since there are multiple routes to get to the same 
    destination, this redundancy can help with error-resistance. 
    - Once the information arrives, there's a TCP which helps to check that all the information 
    needed is delivered properly. 


5. HTTP and HTML

    - To access a webpage, the device is communicating with the server. It is sending a get request: 
    get me the login page, get me the e-commerce section, etc. The server responds by sending 
    HTML (the markdown code that specifies the website make-up). If there are images, photos, or 
    audio files on the webpage, separate get requests are sent for each of those elements to the server.

    - To send information to the webpage, such as to enter login information, the device is sending a 
    post request to the server. The server will respond with sending the appropriate web page. The 
    next time you login into the same page, cookie information will also be sent, essentially 
    allow you to access your login page since you've logged in before. 

    - Since the internet is open, to make sure secure connection between a device and a webpage, 
    there's SSL and TLS. Essentially to connect to you, a server must send you a unique certificate.
    This certificate is issued by certificate authorities (similar to governments issuing passports).
    When you go on the website, you'd want to see the lock icon and the HTTPS://, which means that 
    your device receives a good certificate.


6. Encryption and public keys and cybersecurity

    - Some common cybercrimes include 1) viruses, 2) DDoS (denial of service), and 3) phishing. 
    - Essentially, similar to real life viruses, cybercriminals can install viruses into the user's 
    computer, take over the computer (i.e access the files, control it remotely), and infect other computers,
    creating bot nets. These bot nets can take down websites by overwhelming the server associated with 
    the website by sending it billions of requests. This is called DDoS.
