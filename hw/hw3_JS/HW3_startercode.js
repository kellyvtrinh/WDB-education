/**
NOTE from the Notion page:
Make sure that when you run each of these functions that the output is the same in Javascript. 
You will be graded on pure correctness. Feel free to copy and paste your python code! 
This is more to learn the language rather than to test your CS 61A knowledge. 
If you need the python solutions, ask one of us and we'll drop them!
