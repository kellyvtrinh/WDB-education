        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The rabbits in Potter's stories are anthropomorphic 
            and wear human clothes: Peter wears a blue jacket 
            with brass buttons and shoes. Peter, his widowed 
            mother, Mrs. Josephine Rabbit, as well as his 
            sisters, Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail live in a 
            rabbit hole that has a human kitchen, human 
            furniture, as well as a shop where Josephine 
            sells various items. </p>

        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>Peter Rabbit made his first appearance in 1902 in The 
            Tale of Peter Rabbit. Where Peter disobeys Josephine's 
            orders and sneaks into Mr. McGregor's garden, eating as 
            many vegetables as he can before Mr. McGregor spots and 
            chases him. Peter manages to escape, but not before losing 
            his jacket and shoes, which Mr. McGregor uses to dress a 
            scarecrow. Peter returns home weary, ill, and naked and 
            is put to bed with a dose of chamomile tea.</p>
